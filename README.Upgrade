This document describes changes and steps to upgrade from kamaki 0.11 to
kamaki 0.12

1. Update the kamaki configuration with these commands:
  $ kamaki config delete network_cli
  $ kamaki config delete ip_cli

2. Upgrade shell scripts to use the new syntax:
    positional arguments are removed, except if refering to the objects
    e.g., kamaki server info SERVER_ID
    but not kamaki server create NAME IMAGE FLAVOR
    Use mandatory non-positional arguments
    e.g., kamaki server create --name=NAME --image-id=IMAGE_ID --flavor-id=FLAVOR_ID
          kamaki image register --name=NAME --location=IMAGE_LOCATION

Config file
-----------

Kamaki v0.9 will have a new config file with the following format:

  [global]
  default_cloud = some_cloud
  ... more kamaki-related settings ...

  [cloud "some_cloud"]
  url = https://some/cloud/single/authentication/url
  token = user_token==

For more information on the exact format of the kamaki global variables, see
the respective documentation page:
http://www.synnefo.org/docs/kamaki/latest/setup.html#available-options

How to convert the config file
------------------------------

To convert an old config file, backup the old one and then run:

  kamaki -c <config file path> user authenticate

Kamaki will automatically inspect the file and suggest a list of convertions,
namely renamings and discards. Take a look at the list of discarded values,
write down the ones that might be usefull.

If you are sure about the changes, press 'y'.

Kamaki should raise an error, demanding an authentication URL and/or token.

First, you need to go to the clouds UI and find the authentication URL and
token. Then you should think of a name for your cloud, e.g. "mycloud". Now,
feed kamaki with this information:

kamaki -c <config file path> config set cloud.mycloud.url <URL>
kamaki -c <config file path> config set cloud.mycloud.token <token>

Now the configuration file should be kamaki 0.9 ready.
